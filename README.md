# Fuzzy-Phids
## About

This project is a simple React application designed to simulate an online shopping experience. It utilizes the Faker library as well as the Pexely API to seed a PostgreSQL database with insects, which are given details relevant to shoppers.

This web app allows users to interact with the products/insects to add or remove them from the shopping cart. On the Check-Out page, they can review and make changes to their cart. They are able to see the total of the items in their cart and the quantity of items they have added.

Once they choose to check out, they can enter a phone number and delivery address. These two pieces of info are required to make an order. Separating these details from user details allows guests to shop and check out without needing to sign up.

## React + Vite
```
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working with Vite and includes hot module replacement (HMR) and ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available for React with Vite:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh.
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh.
```
